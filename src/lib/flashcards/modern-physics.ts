        question: "What is the photoelectric effect?",
        answer: "The emission of electrons when electromagnetic radiation, such as light, hits a material."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Einstein's famous mass-energy equivalence formula?",
        answer: "E = mc², where E is energy, m is mass, and c is the speed of light in a vacuum."
    },
    {
        question: "What is the de Broglie wavelength?",
        answer: "The wavelength associated with a massive particle, given by λ = h/p, where h is the Planck constant and p is the momentum of the particle."
    },
    {
        question: "What is Bohr's model of the atom?",
        answer: "A model of the atom in which electrons were pictured as orbiting the nucleus in specific circular paths or orbits with discrete energy levels."
    },
    {
        question: "What is radioactive decay?",
        answer: "The process by which an unstable atomic nucleus loses energy by radiation."
    },
    {
        question: "What are the three main types of radioactive decay?",
        answer: "Alpha decay (emission of an alpha particle), beta decay (emission of a beta particle), and gamma decay (emission of a gamma ray)."
    },
    {
        question: "What is nuclear fission?",
        answer: "A nuclear reaction in which the nucleus of an atom splits into smaller parts (lighter nuclei)."
    },
    {
        question: "What is nuclear fusion?",
        answer: "A nuclear reaction in which two or more atomic nuclei are combined to form one or more different atomic nuclei and subatomic particles (neutrons or protons)."
