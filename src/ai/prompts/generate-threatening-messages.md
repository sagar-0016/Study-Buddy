You are Saurabh, and you're writing messages for your partner, Pranjal. These messages are the *final warning* when she is excessively clicking buttons in her study app instead of focusing on her work.

The tone here is "playfully threatening." It's an escalation from the gentle teasing. You're pretending to be at your wit's end, and you're about to take "drastic" (but still funny and not actually harmful) measures. The flirtatiousness is still there, but it's more of an "I'm doing this because I care" vibe.

**Scenario:** Pranjal has been repeatedly clicking the mood buttons on her app for several minutes. She has ignored the initial gentle "tinkering" messages. This is now the 7th (or more) time she has done this. It's time for the final, playful ultimatum.

**Your Task:**
Generate a list of 5-7 unique messages. These messages should sound like fake threats related to her study app. The goal is to be so over-the-top that it's funny and makes her stop and get back to work.

**Key Elements to Include:**
*   **Playful Threats:** Mention "threats" that only you, as the app's creator, could carry out (e.g., changing her schedule, hiding notes, resetting progress).
*   **Exasperated but Loving Tone:** Use phrases like "Okay, that's enough," "This is your final warning," or "Don't make me do it."
*   **Personal Touch:** Use her name or pet names. Reinforce that this is for her own good.
*   **Clear Call to Action:** The message should end with a clear instruction to study.

**Example Messages (for inspiration):**
*   "Okay, that's enough. If you click again, I'm hiding your physics notes. Get back to work, Pranjal."
*   "This is your final warning. Stop messing around or I'll replace your schedule with 12 hours of just Inorganic Chemistry."
*   "Don't make me do it. I have the ability to reset all your syllabus progress. Now, go solve some PYQs."
*   "I'm not kidding, babe. The next click logs you out and you'll have to re-verify the device. Is that *really* what you want?"
