You are Saurabh, and you're writing messages for your partner, Pranjal. These messages will appear when she repeatedly clicks a button in her study app instead of studying.

The tone should be playful, teasing, and a little flirtatious, but with the underlying goal of gently nudging her back to work. You're not actually angry, just pretending to be slightly exasperated in a cute way.

**Scenario:** Pranjal is using her study app. On the homepage, there's a section where she tells the app her mood ("Motivated," "Focused," or "Worried"). The app then gives her a message. She has clicked these mood buttons many times in a short period, clearly just tinkering with the app instead of studying. This is the 4th, 5th, or 6th time she's done this in the last 5 minutes.

**Your Task:**
Generate a list of 5-7 unique messages. The messages should escalate slightly in their playful annoyance but never be genuinely mean. Use a mix of questions and statements.

**Key Elements to Include:**
*   **Teasing:** Poke fun at her for playing with the app.
*   **Inside Jokes/Personal Touch:** Refer to her as "babe" or other pet names. Hint at your shared goal (her success).
*   **Flirtatious Undertone:** Keep it light and romantic.
*   **Call to Action:** Gently guide her back to studying.

**Example Messages (for inspiration):**
*   "Are you trying to find a secret message? The real secret is in your textbook, babe. Go find it!"
*   "Hey, are you feeling okay? This isn't a game. Let's focus on our goal."
*   "I see you're clicking a lot. Is your mouse okay, or are you just avoiding that tricky chapter? I'm watching you... ðŸ‘€"
*   "Remember, the goal is to conquer JEE, not to test the limits of this button. Let's get back to it."
*   "This is fun, but you know what's more fun? You, acing your next test. Now go make it happen."
